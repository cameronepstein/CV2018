## Lead Developer at Dojo/Kyra

For the last year and a half I have worked as a developer at Dojo/Kyra. Focusing on web & applications development, data engineering, dev ops, targeted advertising, marketing strategy & data science.

So far, coding has been one of the most academically challenging activities in my life. Arriving at work each day with the expectation of solving new, demanding problems has lead to noticeable improvements as well as an increased drive to understand previously unknown technologies.  

Personally, I feel that the constantly evolving, creative environment in tech allows me to best utilise the qualities I posses.

I enjoy working in teams, have great inter-personal skills and truly believe I have thrived as a developer.

## Skills

##### Various Technologies :computer:

I use a variety of different technologies in my current role. Please see main skills below:

* Javascript
* PHP
* PostgreSQL/MySQL/Redshift/NoSql
* Node
* AWS
* Ruby
* Google Analytics
* Git
* Adwords

##### Data Engineering/Data Science :bar_chart:

I create data mining applications, used to pull data from a chosen service (google, youtube, instagram, facebook). This data allows me to conduct experiments and make conclusions based on current tech strategy (i.e. whether users respond better to a red or a blue 'buy it now' button. Or what type of youtube thumbnail image to choose).  

In my current role I often run data experiments aimed at providing us with deeper insights into requested subject matters or future ideas.

##### Data Visualisation :bar_chart:

I regularly add data visualisation pages to my mining applications. These pages display data in a simple, easily understandable way and allow users to apply strict methodologies to their work, with a previously defined goal in mind.

##### Website Development :computer:

I enjoy web design and development. Working with others to create something that's not only eye catching but also useable is an enjoyable process.

##### Application Development :computer:

I work on the Dojo app as well as any updates to our CMS. Additionally I have worked on several in house products for use with our team.  

##### New Technologies :iphone:

I've enjoyed learning new languages every couple of months. Despite the constant imposter syndrome, I am now proficient in many technologies which previously seemed perplexing.

  I have taken on Node and Rails for web apps, database languages, and a variety of front-end technologies over the past year (HTML5, CSS, Sass).

  Essentially this sustained problem solving has provided me with a constant thirst for new exciting tech. With this in mind I aim to continue learning as much as possible in my next career, enhancing my academic and technical ability as well as working on new exciting projects.

##### Agile Development :chart_with_upwards_trend:

Firm follower of the agile development principles. Strong belief that they not only play a key role in developer happiness but also lead to success in business.

##### TDD :traffic_light:

Strong background in TDD, with experience in Rspec, Jasmine, Mocha, Chai and more.

##### Domain Modelling :rocket:

Avid enthusiast of the domain modelling process. Particularly when coordinating group ideas.

##### Inter-personal/Teamwork :city_sunrise:

Enjoy working with and organising teams, particularly fond of pair programming.

##### Simplicity :nut_and_bolt:

Actively design software with single responsibility principle in mind.
